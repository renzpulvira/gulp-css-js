If you want to just use sass & jquery/javascript for your next HTML/Wordpress from scratch project.
You can use this to jumpstart your development.

## Features
### Scss
- sass - compile `.scss` files to `.css`
- cssnano - Minify your output css
- postcss - support backward compatible for your css

### Javascript

## Watched files
Files are automatically processed when you save your `.scss` or `.js` files from the `dev` folder.


## Usage
1. clone the repo `https://github.com/renzpulvira/gulp-css-js.git`
2. cd `gulp-css-js`
